# HiBuffer
Buffer analysis is a fundamental function in geographic information system (GIS), which identifies areas by
surrounding geographic features in a given distance. Real-time buffer analysis for large scale spatial data remains a challenging problem since the computational scales of conventional data-oriented methods expand rapidly with data volumes. In this program, we present a visualization-oriented model, HiBuffer, for real-time buffer analysis. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach can reduce computation time by up to orders of magnitude while preserving better visualization effects. An demonstration of HiBuffer is provided on the Web.
